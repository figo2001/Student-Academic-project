## About the Project

The project leverages the XGBoost algorithm, a scalable and accurate implementation of gradient boosting machines, to predict student academic classification. It utilizes features such as student demographics, past academic performance, and socio-economic factors to build a robust classification model.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploring the provided notebooks)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git
   ```
2. Install required packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook `student_academic_classification.ipynb`.
2. Follow along with the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build the XGBoost model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Customize the model as needed for your specific use case.
4. Experiment with hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering to enhance the model's performance.
5. Integrate the model into your application or educational system for real-world deployment.
